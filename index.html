    <!-- Skeletal System -->
    <section id="skeletal">
      <h2>Skeletal System</h2>
      <p>The skeletal system is the internal framework of the body, consisting of bones, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. It provides support, protection for internal organs, and serves as a point of attachment for muscles. The human skeletal system is an endoskeleton, with bones lying underneath the skin and muscles. 
</p>
      <img src="https://k8schoollessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/human-skeletal-system.jpg" alt="Human skeleton diagram">
      <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
      <p>The human body has 206 bones, but babies are born with around 270 bones, which fuse together as they grow!</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Muscular System -->
    <section id="muscular">
      <h2>Muscular System</h2>
      <p>The muscular system is a set of tissues in the body with the ability to change shape. Muscle cells connect together and eventually to elements of the skeletal system. When the muscle cells contract, force is created as the muscles pull against the skeleton.</p>

      <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
      <p>The strongest muscle in the human body, based on its size, is the masseter (jaw muscle), which can generate a force of up to 200 pounds of pressure!</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Circulatory System -->
    <section id="circulatory">
      <h2>Circulatory System</h2>
      <p>The circulatory system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, transports oxygen, nutrients, and waste products throughout the body.</p>
      <img src="https://media.sciencephoto.com/image/f0062962/800wm/F0062962-Cardiovascular_system,_artwork.jpg" alt="Heart and Blood Vessels">
      <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
      <p>The human heart beats about 100,000 times a day and pumps around 2,000 gallons of blood through 60,000 miles of blood vessels!</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Digestive System -->
    <section id="digestive">
      <h2>Digestive System</h2>
      <p>The digestive system processes food, absorbs nutrients, and removes waste. It includes organs like the stomach and intestines.</p>
      <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.SWHwNZ6h9iIXH4PbXzuVlQHaHa?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="Digestive Organs">
      <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
      <p>Your stomach has an acidic environment (pH 1.5 to 3.5), which is strong enough to dissolve metals like zinc!</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Respiratory System -->
    <section id="respiratory">
      <h2>Respiratory System</h2>
      <p>The respiratory system allows us to breathe, supplying oxygen to the blood and removing carbon dioxide from the body.</p>
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1612479631479-348542dc6b7f" alt="Lungs">
      <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
      <p>The average person breathes in and out about 20,000 times per day without even thinking about it!</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Nervous System -->
    <section id="nervous">
      <h2>Nervous System</h2>
      <p>The nervous system controls body activities and allows communication between different body parts via the brain and spinal cord.</p>
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1603227417420-cf51963f51b3" alt="Brain and Nerve Network">
      <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
      <p>The brain has about 100 billion neurons, which communicate with each other through electrical signals!</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Endocrine System -->
    <section id="endocrine">
      <h2>Endocrine System</h2>
      <p>The endocrine system controls the body’s hormones, which regulate growth, metabolism, and other vital functions.</p>
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596078068967-d8965d3a6f0a" alt="Endocrine Glands">
      <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
      <p>The pituitary gland, known as the “master gland,” controls many other glands in the body and is often referred to as the "control center" for hormone production.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Lymphatic System -->
    <section id="lymphatic">
      <h2>Lymphatic System</h2>
      <p>The lymphatic system is responsible for fighting infections and returning excess fluid to the bloodstream.</p>
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1562207563-e4c07562d4b3" alt="Lymphatic System Diagram">
      <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
      <p>Your tonsils, which are part of the lymphatic system, help protect your body from germs by trapping bacteria and viruses that enter through your mouth and nose!</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Urinary System -->
    <section id="urinary">
      <h2>Urinary System</h2>
      <p>The urinary system removes waste products from the blood and regulates the body's water and salt balance.</p>
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1613274820386-9fa71f699fba" alt="Kidneys and Urinary System">
      <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
      <p>Your kidneys filter about 50 gallons of blood each day to remove waste and excess fluid from your body!</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Reproductive System -->
    <section id="reproductive">
      <h2>Reproductive System</h2>
      <p>The reproductive system allows organisms to reproduce. It includes the organs responsible for producing offspring.</p>
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1584641462310-740b03d93e16" alt="Reproductive Organs">
      <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
      <p>The human body is capable of creating a new life! In just nine months, a fertilized egg develops into a fully formed baby with over 200 bones and countless other complex systems.</p>
